This is a curated list of some restaurants we have found to be of good quality and reasonable price range. We hope it helps you during your
visit.

## Dottie Audrey's Bakery Kitchen
$$ - 8 miles (12.8km) - [See on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/4qeDUCVbgQm)

Great nearby restaurant for a quick breakfast pastry or sandwich with coffee, or a sit down lunch with a small but delicious menu. Very
popular, busy on weekends especially during the summer

## Sushiville
$$ - 4 miles (6.5km) - [See on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/oW2fPnWLCV82)

Simple but tasty sushi with hospitable owners. Teriyaki, Katsu and Korean dishes available for those who dislike sushi.

## Fink's BBQ and Cheesesteak Roadhouse
$ - 7 miles (11.2km) - [See on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/ZyT7NsMXdWo)

Delicious local barbeque with many options on their menu for appetites and budgets. We especially love their happy hour menu from 5-7pm on
week nights.

## Bagel Train
$ - 7.5 miles (12km) - [See on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/G66N2ffrzZS2)

Quintessential New York bagels. This place ALWAYS has a line and for a reason. The line moves fast thanks to many employees, but be sure you
know what you want when you get to the counter.

## MexicanZingo Restaurant
$ - 13 miles (21km) - [See on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/kyaQayBGK7G2)

Small Mexican sit down restaurant with good $2.50 tacos. Fresh and as close to authentic as you can get out here.

## The Helm
$$$ - 14 miles (22km) - [See on Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/KvmbhLV1hy92)

We have heard many good things about this more upscale restaurant on scenic Greenwood Lake. A menu full of delcious sounding food with nice
cocktails and beer options. A nice place to go out for the evening.
